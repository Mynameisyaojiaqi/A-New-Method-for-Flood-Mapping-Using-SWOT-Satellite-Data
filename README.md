ðŸŒŠ A New Method for Flood Mapping Using SWOT Flood Volume Estimation (SWOT-FVE)
Introduction
This repository provides code, sample data, and visualization materials for two case studies of flood monitoring and modeling using SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) satellite water surface elevation (WSE) observations.

Key Features

SWOT Data Preprocessing: Read and filter L2_HR_Raster (WSE) and quality grids.

Noise Removal: Apply Fourier transformâ€“based denoising for striping artifacts.

Flood Volume Estimation: Estimate monthly flood volume using probability distribution functions (PDF/CDF).

Flood Modeling: Integrate SWOT-derived WSE into hydrological models to improve simulation accuracy.

Visualization: Generate GeoTIFF maps, time series plots, and flood risk assessment figures.
